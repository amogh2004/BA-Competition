## Introduction

**Purpose**

The report addresses the increasing challenges in managing SBA loan
defaults by using advanced analytics to predict risk and optimize
lending practices. The primary goal was to develop an accurate and
interpretable model to predict SBA loan default probability
(\`MIS_Status\`). Key objectives included:

1\. Identifying the most influential variables impacting loan default.

2\. Optimizing a loan approval strategy using cost-sensitive metrics.

3\. Providing actionable recommendations for banks to mitigate financial
risks while supporting small businesses.

**Scope**

The study evaluates key predictors of loan outcomes, builds machine
learning models to classify defaults, and develops recommendations for
actionable strategies. The insights can help lenders reduce
default-related losses and strategically allocate loan resources to
improve financial returns, especially under economic constraints and
regulatory frameworks (e.g., Basel III).

**Background**

As a critical source of funding for small businesses, SBA loans support
economic growth and job creation. However, loan defaults impose
financial risks. This study aims to mitigate these risks through
data-driven strategies.

**Research Question**

What factors influence the likelihood of default for SBA loans, and how
can these factors be utilized to predict loan outcomes while maximizing
bank profitability?

**Hypotheses**

> \- Null Hypothesis (H₀): There is no significant relationship between
> variables such as loan disbursement times, borrower details, and loan
> features (e.g., term, low documentation) and the probability of loan
> defaults (MIS_Status).
>
> \- Alternative Hypothesis (H₁): Specific factors such as loan
> disbursement times, borrower details, and loan features significantly
> impact loan default outcomes.

**Research Design**

The study utilized a combination of descriptive, correlation, and
experimental designs to investigate SBA loans:

1.Descriptive Design: Analyzed key metrics (e.g., loan
approval/disbursement times, charge-off trends) to understand basic
patterns in the dataset.

2.Correlation Design: Explored relationships between numerical variables
(e.g., loan amount, term) and outcomes (\`MIS_Status\`).

**Experimental Design**

Employed machine learning classification models to predict loan statuses
(\`MIS_Status\`) and quantify the effect of variables on outcomes.

A.  **Methodology**

Let us first start with Exploratory Data Analysis.

1.  Loading and Inspecting the Dataset

The dataset was loaded using Python\'s pandas library and inspected for
its shape, column names, and data types. It consists of 899,164 rows and
27 columns, representing information about loans, businesses, and loan
statuses.

Missing values and data types were reviewed to identify cleaning and
preprocessing needs.

2.  Descriptive Statistics

Summary statistics such as mean, median, and standard deviation were
calculated for numeric columns. These metrics provide insights into
central tendencies, variability, and the presence of outliers in the
data.

3.  Visualization of Data Distributions

Histograms, bar plots, and boxplots were used to analyze the spread,
skewness, and trends within the dataset.

Correlation Analysis

A correlation matrix and heatmap were generated to assess relationships
among numeric variables and detect multicollinearity issues.

Category-Level Analysis

Bar plots and count plots were created for categorical variables to
explore the frequency and distribution of values such as loan statuses
and regional trends.

4.  Key Observations and Insights from Visualizations

> geographic and industry- level analysis.

**C. Data Pre-processing**

1\. Loading and Inspecting Data:

a)  The dataset SBAnational.csv was loaded and inspected to understand
    its structure and content. Preliminary observations included:

b)  Categorical columns: Variables like State, BankState, RevLineCr,
    UrbanRural, State, NAICS and LowDoc.

c)  Numerical columns: ChgOffPrinGr, Terms, DisbursementGross and
    principal balance.

d)  Target variable: MIS_Status, indicating whether a loan was repaid or
    charged off.

2\. Feature Engineering:

a)  Temporal variables such as DisbursementTime, ChgOffTime,
    and DisbursementToChgOffTime were created. These features quantify
    the duration between key events like loan approval, disbursement,
    and charge-off, capturing important time dynamics affecting loan
    outcomes.

b)  The newly calculated columns (DisbursementTime, ChgOffTime,
    DisbursementToChgOffTime) serve as derived features that provide
    additional context about loan behavior over time.

c)  These features can significantly enhance the predictive power of
    models by capturing time-based patterns.

d)  Time intervals between loan approval, disbursement, and charge-off
    can be key indicators of loan performance.

e)  These time-based features are critical inputs for models predicting
    loan defaults (MIS_Status), as they capture temporal dynamics that
    static features (e.g., loan amount, interest rate) cannot.

3\. Data Cleaning:

a)  LoanNr_ChkDgt: Identifier for the loan number, which doesn\'t
    provide meaningful information for analysis.

b)  Name, City, Zip, Bank: These columns might contain sensitive or
    irrelevant information for modeling (e.g., personal identifiers).
    Removing irrelevant or redundant columns reduces the dimensionality
    of the dataset, which can improve the performance of machine
    learning models and simplify exploratory data analysis.

c)  ApprovalDate, ChgOffDate, DisbursementDate: These columns were used
    earlier for calculating derived features (DisbursementTime,
    ChgOffTime, DisbursementToChgOffTime). Since the raw dates are no
    longer required, they can be dropped to avoid redundancy.

d)  The sba_loans DataFrame is streamlined, containing only columns that
    are essential for further analysis or modeling.

e)  Non-numeric categorical values (NewExist, RevLineCr, LowDoc) were
    converted into numeric formats for compatibility with machine
    learning algorithms.

f)  Missing and invalid entries in critical columns were removed to
    ensure data quality.

4\. Feature Scaling:

a)  Machine learning models in scikit-learn cannot work directly with
    categorical string data. Label encoding converts these strings into
    numeric representations, making them suitable for modeling.

b)  Encoding ensures all categories are uniformly represented as
    integers, avoiding issues that may arise from mixed data types.

c)  Although LabelEncoder assigns random labels, it is sufficient for
    columns like State, BankState, and NAICS, where no natural order
    exists.

5\. Statistical Analysis:

a\. Correlation Analysis:

-   Correlation analysis was performed to evaluate the linear
    relationship between predictors and the target variable. Key
    takeaways:

-   High Correlation: Features like ChgOffPrinGr (Charged-Off Principal
    Balance) and Term exhibited significant correlations
    with MIS_Status.

-   A higher charge-off principal balance increases the likelihood of
    loan default.

-   Longer loan terms are associated with a higher risk of default,
    reflecting potential economic volatility over extended periods.

-   Weak Correlations: Features like SBA_Appv, GrAppv,
    DisbursementGross, and DisbursementTime have weak correlations but
    might still be useful.

-   Very Weak or No Correlation: Features like NoEmp, CreateJob,
    RetainedJob, BalanceGross, and ChgOffTime are weakly correlated and
    may have minimal impact on predicting MIS_Status.

2\. ANOVA (Analysis of Variance):

-   ANOVA was used to assess the statistical significance of numerical
    features in distinguishing between the loan repayment statuses
    (MIS_Status).

-   Significant Features:DisbursementTime and ChgOffPrinGr were
    statistically significant, indicating their strong influence on loan
    outcomes.

-   Interpretation:The time between loan disbursement and
    repayment/charge-off plays a crucial role in understanding default
    behavior.

-   The charged-off principal highlights the financial burden of failed
    loans.

3\. Chi-Square Test:

-   Chi-Square tests evaluated the dependency between categorical
    variables and the target variable (MIS_Status).

-   Significant Variables:All listed features are statistically
    significant, with p-values below 0.05, indicating that there is a
    meaningful association with the target variable, MIS_Status.

-   The highest Chi2 statistics are seen with UrbanRural, RevLineCr, and
    NewExist, suggesting these may be particularly strong predictors of
    loan risk.

-   Revolving credit and low documentation loans are inherently riskier,
    especially in volatile economic conditions.

-   Urban versus rural location differences reflect regional economic
    disparities and their impact on loan performance.

-   Most Important Feature: BankState has the highest F-statistic among
    these features, suggesting it might be the most significant
    predictor among them.

-   Significant Features: State, BankState, and NAICS are all
    statistically significant, with p-values of 0.

**The features that are going to highly influence Probability of
Default:**

1\. ChgOffPrinGr (Num):A high charge-off principal balance is a direct
measure of loan defaults and reflects broader economic conditions like
unemployment, market volatility, or financial crises. During recessions
or economic downturns, businesses often struggle to generate sufficient
revenue to cover their liabilities, resulting in higher charge-off
balances.

2\. Term (Num)- By including loan duration in predictive models, we can
capture the risk associated with long-term economic variability. Loans
with longer terms are more likely to default due to their prolonged
exposure to unfavorable economic events

3\. UrbanRural (Cat)- This categorical variable provides insights into
regional economic health and its impact on loan performance.
Understanding whether the borrower is in an urban or rural area helps
capture location-based risks in the prediction model.

4\. RevLineCr (Cat)- Revolving credit signals borrowers' liquidity
management. During economic downturns, businesses relying heavily on
revolving credit may face increased difficulty maintaining cash flow due
to tightened credit conditions or rising interest rates.

5\. LowDoc (Cat)- Low documentation loans, often granted during periods
of economic optimism or credit booms, are inherently riskier due to
minimal financial scrutiny, leaving borrowers vulnerable during economic
contractions. This feature serves as a strong risk signal, especially
when combined with factors like high loan amounts or weak industry
performance, enhancing its predictive power for defaults.

6\. BankState (Cat)- A bank's location reflects state-specific economic
conditions and policies, with stronger economies linked to lower default
rates. This feature captures geographic variations, enhancing the
model's ability to predict defaults accurately.

7\. State (Cat)- Borrower state reflects regional economic conditions
that directly affect businesses. For instance, states reliant on oil or
agriculture may experience higher default rates during commodity price
downturns. Conversely, states with diversified economies may show better
loan performance.

8\. NAICS (Cat)- Understanding industry-specific risks allows a more
nuanced assessment of default probability. The NAICS code is a valuable
predictor as it enables the model to associate industry risk profiles
with default behavior, especially under macroeconomic stressors like
recessions or sectoral downturns.

9\. We also need DisbursementGross as need that to calculate net profit
of the model.

After data pre-processing we have created a file named
**selected_sba_loans_data.csv** in which we have included the final
cleaned dataset which is ready for data modelling and interpretations.

**D. Data Modelling**

1\. Data Loading and Initial Exploration

The first step involves loading the dataset using the \`pandas\`
library. The dataset, named \`selected_sba_loans_data.csv\`, contains
information on loan details and statuses. Once the data is loaded, a
quick review of its structure reveals that it has 613,723 rows and 10
columns. These columns represent features such as loan disbursement
amounts, loan terms, and the target variable \`MIS_Status\`, which
indicates whether a loan was paid (\`0\`) or defaulted (\`1\`).

2\. Feature Selection and Train-Test Split

-   Feature selection involves choosing the most relevant columns for
    the machine learning task. In this case, the columns
    \`ChgOffPrinGr\`, \`Term\`, \`UrbanRural\`, \`RevLineCr\`,
    \`LowDoc\`, \`BankState\`, \`State\`, and \`NAICS\` are selected as
    predictors (\`X\`), while the column \`MIS_Status\` serves as the
    target variable (\`y\`). The dataset is then split into training and
    testing subsets, using 80% of the data for training and 20% for
    testing.

-   The column \`DisbursementGross\` is excluded from modeling but
    preserved for later evaluation of predictions on the test set.

-   A balanced distribution between training and test sets is ensured by
    using random splitting with a fixed seed.

The separation of training and testing data ensures that models are
evaluated on unseen data, preventing overfitting and providing a more
realistic measure of model performance.

3\. Addressing Class Imbalance

-   The target variable \`MIS_Status\` is imbalanced, with far fewer
    loans classified as defaults (\`1\`) compared to those paid off
    (\`0\`). To address this, the Synthetic Minority Oversampling
    Technique (SMOTE) is applied. SMOTE generates synthetic examples of
    the minority class in the training dataset, making the classes
    balanced and improving model sensitivity to the minority class.

-   The training data becomes balanced, with an equal number of samples
    for both \`MIS_Status = 0\` and \`MIS_Status = 1\`.

-   Balancing the data ensures that machine learning models are not
    biased toward the majority class and are better equipped to identify
    defaults (\`1\`).

4\. Models

**Model 1:** k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)

kNN classifies loans based on similarity to their neighbors using a
Manhattan distance metric. This distance metric calculates absolute
differences between feature values, which makes it more robust to
outliers compared to Euclidean distance. However, the performance of kNN
is heavily influenced by the choice of the number of neighbors (k) and
the scale of the data.

Output:

Accuracy: 92%

Precision (Default): 79%

Recall (Default): 79%

Weighted F1-score: 0.92

Net Profit: - \$49,987,428.50

Observation: 

While kNN achieves moderate accuracy, its reliance on local patterns
rather than global trends leads to misclassification in high-dimensional
data. This limitation results in a significant number of false
positives, directly impacting the net profit. The simplicity of the
model makes it less effective in capturing complex relationships within
the dataset, thereby limiting its utility for SBA\'s financial risk
assessment.

**Model 2:** Decision Tree Classifier

Decision trees split the data iteratively based on feature thresholds,
creating an interpretable tree-like structure. This model is highly
effective for datasets with strong feature interactions, as it can
capture both categorical and continuous variable splits.

Output:

Accuracy: 99%

Precision (Default): 100%

Recall (Default): 99%

Weighted F1-score: 0.99

Net Profit: \$116,307,604.50

Observation: 

Decision trees provide excellent interpretability, allowing SBA
stakeholders to clearly understand the factors driving high-risk loan
classifications. For example, splits on features
like UrbanRural or LowDoc can reveal critical insights into which loans
are more likely to default, helping to refine lending criteria for
different borrower profiles.

**Model 3:** Random Forest Classifier

Random forests build multiple decision trees and aggregate their
predictions, reducing variance and improving generalization.

Output:

Accuracy: 99%

Precision (Default): 100%

Recall (Default): 99%

Weighted F1-score: 0.99

Net Profit: \$113,016,941.00

Observation: Random forests provide consistent results but slightly
lower profitability compared to decision trees.

**Model 4:** Bagging Classifier

Bagging, or Bootstrapped Aggregating, combines predictions from multiple
models trained on different bootstrapped samples of the dataset. This
technique helps reduce variance by ensuring each model sees slightly
different data, which improves stability and generalization. Bagging
classifiers are particularly useful in mitigating overfitting for
decision tree-based models.

Output:

Accuracy: 99%

Precision (Default): 100%

Recall (Default): 99%

Weighted F1-score: 0.99

Net Profit: \$116,307,604.50

Observation: 

Bagging's ensemble approach mirrors the need for diversified risk
assessment in SBA's portfolio. The stability provided by aggregating
predictions across multiple models makes it highly effective for
managing diverse loan scenarios under varying macroeconomic conditions.

**Model 5:** Gradient Boosting Classifier

Description: Sequentially builds models to reduce prediction errors
iteratively.

Output:

Accuracy: 99%

Precision (Default): 100%

Recall (Default): 99%

Weighted F1-score: 0.99

Net Profit: \$116,307,604.50

Observation: Effectively captures complex relationships in data.

**Model 6:** XGBoost

XGBoost is an advanced gradient boosting algorithm that incorporates
regularization (L1 and L2) and efficient tree-pruning strategies. It
employs parallel processing for faster computation and manages missing
data effectively, making it highly adaptable to large datasets like SBA
loans. These optimization techniques allow the model to capture nuanced
relationships in the data while avoiding overfitting.

Output:

Accuracy: 99%

Precision (Default): 100%

Recall (Default): 99%

Weighted F1-score: 0.99

Net Profit: \$116,372,293.10

Observation: 

XGBoost's ability to balance precision and recall while maximizing
profitability makes it the best-performing model. Its regularization
techniques ensure stability, while its speed and efficiency enable
handling of complex patterns, such as the interaction between loan
disbursement amounts, geographic disparities, and industry-specific
risks. This adaptability aligns perfectly with SBA's goal to support
small businesses while minimizing financial losses.

**Model 7:** Logistic Regression

Logistic regression is used to model the probability of loan defaults as
a linear function of predictors. In this analysis, three variations of
logistic regression are employed:

-   Ridge (L2 Regularization): Penalizes large coefficients to prevent
    overfitting, particularly useful for datasets with
    multicollinearity.

-   Lasso (L1 Regularization): Shrinks less important coefficients to
    zero, effectively performing feature selection.

-   Elastic Net (Combination of L1 and L2 Regularization): Balances
    feature selection and coefficient shrinkage for improved
    performance.

Output:

-   Ridge Logistic Regression:

> Accuracy: 99%
>
> Precision (Default): 98%
>
> Recall (Default): 95%
>
> Weighted F1-score: 0.97
>
> Net Profit: \$115,629,050.45

-   Lasso Logistic Regression:

> Accuracy: 98%
>
> Precision (Default): 98%
>
> Recall (Default): 93%
>
> Weighted F1-score: 0.96
>
> Net Profit: \$105,470,272.90

-   Elastic Net Logistic Regression:

> Accuracy: 98%
>
> Precision (Default): 98%
>
> Recall (Default): 93%
>
> Weighted F1-score: 0.96
>
> Net Profit: \$105,065,693.35

Observation:

-   Ridge regression provides the most robust performance among the
    three, balancing accuracy and financial outcomes.

-   Lasso and Elastic Net regression offer insights into feature
    importance but slightly underperform in terms of net profit.

These models are simpler implement, making them suitable for baseline
comparisons and quick evaluations.

**Model 8:** Neural Network

The neural network implemented here is a multi-layer perceptron (MLP)
model designed to capture complex, non-linear patterns in the data. It
includes multiple hidden layers with ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit)
activation functions to introduce non-linearity. The model is trained
using the Adam optimizer, which efficiently adjusts learning rates for
better convergence, and employs a categorical cross-entropy loss
function suitable for binary classification tasks.

Hyperparameter Tuning:

-   Hidden layers: Adjusted for depth and complexity.

-   Neurons per layer: Tuned to balance model capacity and training
    time.

-   Learning rate: Optimized for faster convergence without
    overshooting.

-   Batch size: Set to handle the dataset size efficiently without
    memory bottlenecks.

Output:

Accuracy: 99%

Precision (Default): 100%

Recall (Default): 98%

Weighted F1-score: 0.99

Net Profit: \$116,232,116.80

Observation: 

Neural networks excel in capturing non-linear interactions among
features, such as complex relationships between loan amount, term, and
geographic risk. Despite their computational intensity, their robust
performance and adaptability make them valuable for nuanced analyses
like SBA's loan evaluations. However, the need for computational
resources and expertise could limit their deployment in real-time
decision-making.

**Model 9**: Discriminant Analysis

Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA): LDA assumes that the data points for
each class are normally distributed and shares the same covariance
structure. It finds a linear combination of features that best separates
the classes by maximizing the ratio of between-class variance to
within-class variance.

Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA): QDA is a more flexible version of
LDA that allows each class to have its own covariance matrix, enabling
it to model more complex decision boundaries for non-linear
separability.

Output:

-   LDA:

> Accuracy: 80%
>
> Precision (Default): 46%
>

5\. Highest Net Profit

Net profit evaluates the financial impact of each model by combining the
benefits of correctly identifying defaults (True Positives) with the
costs of misclassifying loans (False Positives).

-   XGBoost achieves the highest net profit of \$116,372,293.10, making
    it the most effective model for optimizing loan approvals and
    minimizing losses.

    profits of \$116,307,604.50, while Neural Networks also perform well
    at \$116,232,116.80.

-   Logistic Regression (Ridge) provides \$115,629,050.45, balancing
    simplicity and performance.

-   However, simpler models like kNN (-\$49,987,428.50) and Linear
    Discriminant Analysis (-\$729,096,566.95) incur significant losses,
    demonstrating their unsuitability for this dataset.

These insights highlight the importance of selecting advanced ensemble
methods to maximize profit.

6\. Graph Analysis

a\. Gains Chart

-   The gains chart shows the cumulative percentage of true positives
    (correctly predicted defaults) as a function of the percentage of
    the population ranked by the model's predicted probability of
    default.

-   The steeper the curve, the more effective the model is at
    identifying defaults in the top percentages of high-risk loans.

Insights:

-   Models like XGBoost and Gradient Boosting achieve sharp gains early
    in the curve, indicating their ability to capture a significant
    proportion of defaults within the top deciles of high-risk loans.

-   Logistic regression produces a more gradual curve, reflecting less
    focus on prioritizing high-risk cases.

-   The chart demonstrates that advanced models like XGBoost are highly
    effective in targeting the riskiest loans, a critical requirement
    for SBA's financial risk management.

b\. Lift Chart

The lift chart compares the model's ability to identify defaults against
a baseline of random selection. A higher lift value in the initial
deciles indicates better prioritization of high-risk loans.

Insights:

-   XGBoost and Gradient Boosting achieve the highest lift values in the
    top deciles, demonstrating superior performance in identifying
    high-risk loans compared to other models.

-   Lift values diminish in the later deciles, indicating reduced
    returns as the model reaches lower-probability cases.

-   This chart underscores the practical advantage of advanced models in
    focusing resources on high-risk loans.

**E. Conclusion**

**Key Achievements:**

The analysis of SBA loan defaults was systematically approached using a
combination of exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and
predictive modeling. This comprehensive methodology addressed the
challenges of identifying factors influencing loan defaults and
developed a reliable framework to predict loan outcomes.

1\. Addressing Class Imbalance:

The imbalance in loan statuses (paid vs. default) was mitigated using
SMOTE, which ensured balanced training data. This step significantly
improved the sensitivity of models to defaults, allowing for better
prediction of high-risk loans.

2\. Feature Selection and Engineering:

Key features such as ChgOffPrinGr, Term, and categorical variables
like UrbanRural and NAICS were identified as critical predictors.
Derived time-based features (e.g., DisbursementTime, ChgOffTime)
enhanced the models by capturing temporal dynamics in loan performance.

These features allowed models to account for economic factors such as
regional disparities, industry-specific risks, and temporal changes in
loan behavior.

3\. Model Selection and Optimization:

a\. Multiple machine learning models were evaluated, including kNN,
Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost.

b\. XGBoost emerged as the best-performing model, achieving a high
accuracy of 99%, with precision (97%), recall (99%), and F1-score
(0.99). It provided the most reliable predictions for defaults,
balancing false positive and false negative rates.

4\. Financial Impact Analysis:

A cost-benefit analysis quantified the financial implications of model
predictions. XGBoost achieved the highest profitability of \$116M by
accurately classifying high-risk loans, reducing default-related losses
while maximizing returns on approved loans.

**Business Implications:**

1\. Enhanced Risk Management by Strategizing Loan Approvals:

By identifying high-risk loans with greater accuracy, the SBA can refine
its loan approval process, focusing on borrowers with a higher
probability of repayment. This reduces financial exposure to defaults.

2\. Region-Specific Insights:

Variables like UrbanRural, State, and BankState enable the SBA to tailor
its strategies based on geographic risk. For instance, rural areas with
higher default probabilities may benefit from additional support
mechanisms or stricter credit assessments.

3\. Compliance with Basel III Framework:

The predictive model aligns with the Basel III guidelines by providing
accurate Probability of Default (PD) estimates. This ensures adequate
capital reserves are maintained, safeguarding the banking system under
economic stress.

4\. Macroeconomic Resilience:

Features like NAICS and Term help assess industry-specific risks and
long-term loan exposures, aligning SBA policies with broader economic
stability goals.

5\. Support for Small Business Growth

By leveraging models to minimize biases, the SBA can ensure fair access
to loans across diverse industries and regions, supporting small
businesses while reducing systemic risks.

6\. Data-Driven Decision Making:

The insights derived from the analysis empower SBA to make informed
decisions that balance financial returns with its mission to promote
small business growth and job creation.
